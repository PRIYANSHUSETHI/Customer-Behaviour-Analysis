# 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes ecommerce customer behavior to uncover insights, identify churn, and segment customers based on engagement and lifetime value. It uses Python for data processing, visualization, and customer analytics.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Loads customer interaction data using `pandas`
- Cleans missing values and prepares data for analysis

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Summarizes numerical and categorical columns with `describe()`

### 3. Visualizations
- Age distribution histogram
- Gender and device usage bar charts
- Browsing vs. viewing scatter plot
- CLV box plots
- Customer funnel (Visitors → Purchasers)
- Churn analysis across demographics

### 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Feature selection:
  - `Total_Purchases`
  - `Items_Added_to_Cart`
  - `Product_Browsing_Time`
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Dimensionality reduction using `PCA`
- CLV scoring and segmentation into 4 tiers: Low, Medium, High, Very High

### 5. Customer Funnel Analysis
- Tracks user journey:
  - Visited site
  - Viewed products
  - Added to cart
  - Completed purchase
- Funnel chart using `plotly.express`

### 6. Churn Analysis
- Defines churn as `Total_Purchases == 0`
- Analyzes churn rates by:
  - Gender
  - Device Type
  - Location
- Visualized using `seaborn.barplot`
